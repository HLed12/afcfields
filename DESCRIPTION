Description: Team includes: Espi Garschina-Bobrow, Moses Millman, and Harry Leduc.
    Project revolves around African Crop Field dataset. We measure uncertainty
    for mapping fields, average field size by country, and an annual
    average field size by country. Data was given by Lyndon Estes. Data is on local
    machines due to data size. Please review vignettes_html for 
    analysis results. If have access to the data, within the project directory,
    there is an additional 'external/afcdata/'. All data is located inside
    afcdata.
